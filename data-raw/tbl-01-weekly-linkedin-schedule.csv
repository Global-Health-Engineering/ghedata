@Saloni, our Ph.D. student, believes it's resourcefulness, especially when research involves fieldwork and is subject to time constraints.
 
Saloni talked about her own experience doing air quality experiments in Malawi. She said, ""Imagine bringing all your tools to Malawi and then realizing there's no right stand to mount the monitors. I was super worried. But thanks to @Hope, our research assistant from Malawi, who said, 'Let's make one.'

Through a new bilateral carbon trading pact, Switzerland is poised to fund the construction of thousands of household biogas reactors in Malawi. In a newly published @eth Zukunfstblog, @GHE Senior Scientist @marc kalina reflects on the track record of similar investments, as well as the ethics of burdening countries like Malawi, located on the frontlines of Southern Africa‚Äôs climate change battle, with failed or failing projects which make little impact on the ground.

What's with the pile of punctured #plasticwaste next to @Lin?


In Malawi, empty #pesticide containers are punctured to prevent others from reusing them (e.g. water storage). 

However, highly concentrated residues from pesticide #packaging and the #plastic itself can still leak into water and soils, which poses serious environmental and human health risks.

Unfortunately, this plastic often has nowhere to go.

In the current linear economy, the cost and burden of disposal is generally passed onto the consumer ‚Äì but safe disposal and #recycling systems for plastic waste are underdeveloped and often inaccessible.

What are better ways to manage pesticide packaging #waste?","image #1 (make sure this goes first!):

His research focuses on waste collection sites spread throughout the city of Zurich. It turns out that a recurring problem emerges where waste is not handled properly, according to regulations. As a result, a significant amount of waste ends up being deposited on the ground. This issue requires the workforce to address the unauthorized disposal. The workers bear the responsibility of manually cleaning the collection sites, they take on this demanding task without the aid of specialized tools or equipment.
 
Dominic's cross-disciplinary thesis encompasses systematic assessment of health at work and technical solution development. Ergonomic analysis methodologies are used for the investigation of physical exertion. Risk assessment tools are applied within this context.
